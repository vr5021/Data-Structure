Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. 
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

My submission
```python3
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        candidate = None
        count = 0

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            if num == candidate:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
```
